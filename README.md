# Planning Ideas for this project

This was created as an update a previous project done in Angela Yu's web dev course on Udemy.

This website allows a user, to create, read, edit, and delete posts all using a custom api.

To start this on your machine, you will need to install the npm packages with `npm i` and then start both the index.js (api) and server.js (backend server).
